I've seen Anthem work on Mono 1.1.12.1 and 1.1.13.2 on a Ubuntu Linux
machine.

Since Mono's support for ASP.NET 2.0 is still not quite complete,
you'll have to use the examples in the Anthem-Examples-2003 folder.

There's a script in Anthem-Examples-2003 folder called mono-build.
Invoking that script should build Anthem and the other code needed for
the examples to run.

Once you've built Anthem, start xsp and browse to Default.aspx.

To use Anthem in your own applications, copy Anthem.dll out of the
Anthem-Examples-2003\bin folder into your application's bin folder and
follow the examples.
