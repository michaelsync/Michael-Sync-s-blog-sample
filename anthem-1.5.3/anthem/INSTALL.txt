Steps to install on Visual Studio 2003
======================================


1. Download the Anthem.NET zip to your hard-disk.

2. Right-click on the zip file, select "Properties" and "Unblock" the files.

3. Unzip the file and copy the created directory 'anthem' with all its
subcontent to a location where you'd want to work with it. Let's
pretend that location is C:\anthem.

4. Create a virtual directory in your Internet Information Services called
"Anthem-Examples-2003" and point it to the following subdirectory (under
anthem):

C:\anthem\Anthem-Examples-2003

Alternatively, you could just right-click the Anthem-Examples-2003
folder, select "Properties", switch to the "Web Sharing" tab, select
"Share this folder", and then accept all of the default settings on
the dialog that appears.

5. Now fire up your VS.NET 2003 and open the project solution file named
"Anthem-2003.sln" or double-click the .sln file directly.

6. Before compiling and running the program make sure you first select the
"Start Up Project" to be 'Anthem-Examples-2003' (using Solution Explorer) and
not 'Anthem-2003', but that one should have been loaded in the first place, and
the reference to it from the WebForm project should be correct.

7. Select the web form you want to be the "Set as Start Page", in this case
'Default.aspx'.

8. Now press F5 (or Ctrl F5) to run in Debug mode (or in Run without
debugging). Note that if VS.NET 2003 complains here saying not being able to
debug is probably caused by not having enabled IIS Integrated Security in the
IIS manager applet.

Steps to install on Visual Studio 2005
======================================


1. Download the Anthem.NET zip to your hard-disk.

2. Right-click on the zip file, select "Properties" and "Unblock" the files.

3. Unzip the file and copy the created directory 'anthem' with all its
subcontent to a location where you'd want to work with it.

4. Open the solution file named "Anthem-2005.sln" and make sure the disk
partition mentioned near the top is the one you actually used; in other words,
in my case the .sln indicated a path C:\...xxx while I placed the solution in
E:\...xxx; here, renaming "C" to "E" suffices.

5. Fire up your VS.NET 2005 IDE and click on 'Open Project' and browse to the
"Anthem-2005.sln" file, then open it.

6. Two projects should appear, one named "Anthem-2005" (the .NET v2.0 library)
and the other "Anthem-Examples-2005" indicating the project path.

7. Select the example project to be the Start Up Project and select
'Default.aspx' to be the "Start Page" (using Solution Explorer) and press F5;
the built-in web server (aka Cassini) starts running and displays the page in
your browser.

Steps to install on Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition
=============================================================


1. Download the Anthem.NET zip to your hard-disk.

2. Right-click on the zip file, select "Properties" and "Unblock" the files.

3. Unzip the file and copy the created directory 'anthem' with all its
subcontent to a location where you'd want to work with it.

4. Open up a command prompt and change into the anthem directory. This
is the directory that contains the file called Anthem-2005.sln.

5. Execute the following command:

%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MSBuild.exe Anthem-2005.sln

Note that %SystemRoot% is an environmental variable that probably
points to C:\WINDOWS.

6. You should see a bunch of output that eventually indicates that the
solution was successfully built with no errors (but possibly a few
warnings).

7. You'll find that a folder called PrecompiledWeb appears after
performing the build but you can ignore or even delete that. The thing
you needed to happen was to build the Anthem.dll assembly and get it
copied over to the Anthem-Examples-2005\bin folder for you.

8. Start Visual Web Developer and select "File | Open Web Site". Open
the Anthem-Examples-2005 folder.

9. You should be able to view the examples by selecting "Debug | Start
Debugging" or "Debug | Start Without Debugging" using the built-in web
server.


============================================
Steps to use Anthem.NET in your own projects
============================================


Add a reference to your project browsing to the anthem subdirectory named
"Anthem-2005" and open the file named 'Anthem-2005.csproj'.

Alternatively, if you want to separate the Anthem project but you'll need for
example if you want to develop on VS.NET 2005 to copy both folders
"Anthem-2005" and "anthem" since the first makes use of the latter.

The same goes for VS.NET 2003 projects, but you should copy the "Anthem-2003"
and "anthem" directories. Once you've determined a final location for the
projects in question, you can add the projects to your solution and after that
you add the project as a reference to your main project you're working on.

Alternatively, you can simply copy the generated dll, place it in your
bin directory; this makes your project independent from the original
project and is fine if nothing's going to change in Anthem.
