Anthem.NET is a AJAX-ish toolkit for ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0.

It should work with any browser that supports JavaScript, the
innerHTML property, and XMLHttpRequest.

It should also work with either Microsoft's CLR or the Mono Runtime
(version 1.1.12.1 or higher).

All of the code has been donated to the public domain.

We're always looking for more developers!
